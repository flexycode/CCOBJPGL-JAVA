# üí´ Lab Exercise 1 - Object and Classes
#### Due today 8/17/2024 at 3:00 PM
#### 30 Points

## ‚úçÔ∏è Instructions
### Machine Problem:

Create a java Object Oriented Formula Program

## ‚ú® Task:
1. Create an Object and Classes for the different formula to solve:

* A: The Circile Formula : **Area of a Circle  A = œÄ √ó r2**
* B: The Triangle Formula: **Area of triangle = ¬Ω √ó base √ó height**
* C: The Temperature Formula:

**Fahrenheit to Celsius: C = (F-32) (5/9)** 

**Celsius to Fahrenheit: F = C(9/5) + 32** 

2. Make a class for each Formula

3. Create a choice of menu for the different formula operations

# üí´ Lab Exercise 3 - Overloading Constructor
#### Due today 8/31/2024 at 3:00 PM
#### 30 Points

## ‚úçÔ∏è Instructions
### Machine Problem:

Create an Employee Record Management that stores the information about employees, use overloading constructor to achive the program requirements

### Requirements, The class should have:

## ‚ú® Task:

1. A default constructor that has no parameter initializes the employee's name to "Unknown Employee" and EmployeeID to 0.
   
2. A parameterized constructor that takes both the employee's name and Employee's ID which is inputted by the user, display both information
   
3. If the constructor that has only the employee's name is inputted and assigns a default employeeID of 911111.

### ‚ú® Sample Output:
```code
Test Case#1:

Employee Name:_
Employee ID no.:_

Employee Information: Unknown Employee, 0

Test Case#2:

Employee Name: Marcus Jack
Employee ID no.:10001

Employee Information: Marcus Jack, 10001

Test Case#3:

Employee Name: Paul Walker
Employee ID no.:

Employee Information: Marcus Jack, 911111

Test Case#4:

Employee Name: Pamela la
Employee ID no.:

Employee Information: Pamela la, 911111
```

# üí´ Lab Exercise 4 - Abstraction and Interface
#### Due today 10/05/2024 at 3:00 PM
#### 30 Points

## ‚úçÔ∏è Instructions
### Machine Problem:

Create a Java OOP Program that will implement abstraction and interfaces to compute the salary of different types of employees.

## ‚ú® Goal:

Create an Employee interface with a method calculateEmpSalary().
Implement the interface in different types of employees:
- FullTimeEmployee
- Employee Name
- Employee Status
- Basic Salary
- Allowance
- Deduction 10% tax in Gross Pay
- Gross Pay: Basic Salary + Allowance
- Net Salary = Gross Pay  - Deduction

Display All the information
       
- PartTimeEmployee
- Employee Name
- Employee Status
- Hourly Rate
- Hours Worked
- Deduction 5% tax in Gross Pay

- Gross Pay: Hourly Rate * Hours Worked
      Net Salary = Gross Pay  - Deduction


### Requirements:

1. Employee Interface:

The Employee interface defines the abstract method calculateEmpSalary().
Both full-time and part-time employees must implement this method to calculate their salary in their own way.

2. Create the following Class:

- FullTimeEmp class that implements Employee interface
- PartTimeEmp class that implements Employee interface
- Mainclass create objects for Full-time and Part-Time Employee and call the method calculateEmpSalary
